# Run — staff follow-along

This folder is for **you and the two designers**. It is the night you
actually run: beats, commands, who speaks, what “done” is, what to do
when a table dies.

It is not the student brief. It is not the deck.

| Folder | Job |
|---|---|
| [`agenda/`](../agenda/README.md) | Scope. What the night closes. Not the clock. |
| [`presentation/`](../presentation/README.md) | What the room sees. |
| **This folder** | What the three of you execute, in order. |

One folder per night. One file per beat, numbered. **One Night** — no
morning / afternoon split. Converge papers: [`docs/`](../docs/README.md).

**Week story:** Nights 2–3 are **Type 01 steel threads** (SWE ingest → landing, then DE landing → Gold). Night 4 **generates remaining swimlanes / SWE+DE tasks** and cranks them (Mesh + Pass 6–8, Linear), then Type `05` unattended. Night 5 is sealed Type `06`.

Night 1 HTML is live — [`d1-archaeologist.html`](../presentation/d1-archaeologist.html) · [`d1/`](d1/README.md).
Night 2 HTML is live — [`d2-translator.html`](../presentation/d2-translator.html) · [`d2/`](d2/README.md). Identify by `data-act-name`.
Night 3 HTML is live — [`d3-constructor.html`](../presentation/d3-constructor.html) · [`d3/`](d3/README.md) (13 beats, four boards). Type 01 Gold steel thread. Identify by `data-act-name`. J5 abstains, then they render the SA mermaids in [`plans/modern.md`](../plans/modern.md).
Days 4–5 staff are stubs.

Kits (park the Night HUD, teach, **return**): [`seamwise.html`](../presentation/seamwise.html), [`task-spec.html`](../presentation/task-spec.html).

## E2E tonight (Night 3)

Do **not** walk 07–11 on `main` — those beats write `docs/` and `modern/`. Use a worktree after the clock is committed. Compose `northwind-pay-legacy` (port 2222) is one plant; do not share it with another checkout.

| Beat | Expect |
|---|---|
| 01 | Ingest signed. 0006 parked. One parser leaf. **No** `modern/landing/` unless emit already ran |
| 02–03 | Nine-pack notebook. Paid grain `batch_id + currency`. Abstain on dlt/dbt if not in the brain |
| 04 | Three mermaids from [`plans/modern.md`](../plans/modern.md). Not an ADR. Dagster on the flowchart = Thursday |
| 05–08 | Lakehouse ADRs + seam 2 legs + `docs/consensus-lakehouse.md`. Do not recut ingest `consensus.md` |
| 09–12 | **Dark** if 08 unsigned. Else Type 01 only: emit → dlt register → B/S/G → golden-match |
| 13 | Lineage · Type 05 subject line · Milestone 4. No Dagster on disk |

`cvg` may error (Task-Spec 3.9 vs 3.8). Agent still writes `docs/`. Do not `cvg init` unless you are also rehearsing Thursday. Do not author Types `02`–`05`. `make deploy` recreates SFTP (`--force-recreate`) so a stale `sftpusers` container cannot fail the boot — stop Compose on `main` first **or remap ports / `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME` on a worktree**. Evidence is gitignored — open it in the **terminal**. Hyphenated `01-card-settlement/` is not an importable package; do not shadow pip `dlt`. See [`d3/README.md`](d3/README.md) Staff traps.

## How to write a beat file

```text
# NN · name
- Slide:
- Who:
- Next: NN+1-….md

## Do / Prompt (verbatim)
## Proof
## If fail
```

Homework for the room is not a beat.

If `agenda/dN.md` and `run/dN/` disagree, **agenda wins on scope**.
Fix the run file. Do not invent a sixth type or a Pass the brief did
not authorize.
