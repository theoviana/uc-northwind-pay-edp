# Run — staff follow-along

This folder is for **you and the two designers**. It is the night you
actually run: beats, commands, who speaks, what “done” is, what to do
when a table dies.

It is not the student brief. It is not the deck.

| Folder | Job |
|---|---|
| [`agenda/`](../agenda/README.md) | Scope. What the night closes. Not the clock. |
| [`presentation/`](../presentation/README.md) | What the room sees. |
| **This folder** | What the three of you execute, in order. |

One folder per night. One file per beat, numbered. **One Night** — no
morning / afternoon split. Converge papers: [`docs/`](../docs/README.md).

**Week story:** Nights 2–3 are **Type 01 steel threads** (SWE ingest → landing, then DE landing → Gold). Night 4 teaches **Context · Eval · Loop**, **walks the Type 01 trail**, then generates remaining SWE+DE and cranks them (Mesh + Pass 6–8, Linear), then Type `05` unattended. Night 5 is sealed Type `06`.

Night 1 HTML is live — [`d1-archaeologist.html`](../presentation/d1-archaeologist.html) · [`d1/`](d1/README.md).
Night 2 HTML is live — [`d2-translator.html`](../presentation/d2-translator.html) · [`d2/`](d2/README.md). Identify by `data-act-name`.
Night 3 HTML is live — [`d3-constructor.html`](../presentation/d3-constructor.html) · [`d3/`](d3/README.md) (13 beats, four boards). Type 01 Gold steel thread. Identify by `data-act-name`. J5 abstains, then they render the SA mermaids in [`plans/modern.md`](../plans/modern.md).
Night 4 staff is live — [`d4/`](d4/README.md) (9 beats, four boards). Trail first, then remaining lanes + Type `05`. Stage live; Floor/Dig follow the clock. Identify by `data-act-name`.
Night 5 staff is live — [`d5/`](d5/README.md) (pre-flight `00` + 6 beats). Pre-flight, recap Type 01 from disk, Linear, look up 02–05, smoke with DuckDB/dbt/Dagster, Type `06` factory, flywheel. Identify by `data-act-name`. Deck: [`presentation/d5-dark-factory.html`](../presentation/d5-dark-factory.html) (28 slides).

Kits (park the Night HUD, teach, **return**): [`seamwise.html`](../presentation/seamwise.html), [`task-spec.html`](../presentation/task-spec.html).

## E2E tonight (Night 3)

Do **not** walk 07–11 on `main` — those beats write `docs/` and `modern/`. Use a worktree after the clock is committed. Compose `northwind-pay-legacy` (port 2222) is one plant; do not share it with another checkout.

| Beat | Expect |
|---|---|
| 01 | Ingest signed. 0006 parked. One parser leaf. **No** `modern/landing/` unless emit already ran |
| 02–03 | Nine-pack notebook. Paid grain `batch_id + currency`. Abstain on dlt/dbt if not in the brain |
| 04 | Three mermaids from [`plans/modern.md`](../plans/modern.md). Not an ADR. Dagster on the flowchart = Thursday |
| 05–08 | Lakehouse ADRs + seam 2 legs + `docs/consensus-lakehouse.md`. Do not recut ingest `consensus.md` |
| 09–12 | **Dark** if 08 unsigned. Else Type 01 only: emit → dlt register → B/S/G → golden-match |
| 13 | Lineage · Type 05 subject line · Milestone 4. No Dagster on disk |

`cvg` may error (Task-Spec 3.9 vs 3.8). Agent still writes `docs/`. Do not author Types `02`–`05` on Night 3. Thursday **does** `cvg init` + pin 3.8.x. `make deploy` recreates SFTP (`--force-recreate`) so a stale `sftpusers` container cannot fail the boot — stop Compose on `main` first **or remap ports / `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME` on a worktree**. Evidence is gitignored — open it in the **terminal**. Hyphenated `01-card-settlement/` is not an importable package; do not shadow pip `dlt`. See [`d3/README.md`](d3/README.md) Staff traps.

## E2E Thursday (Night 4)

Do **not** generate `02`–`05` on `main` if Type 01 Gold is missing — those beats write `docs/` and `modern/`. Use a worktree. Gold missing → walk 01–02 only.

| Beat | Expect |
|---|---|
| 01 | Type 01 Gold **or named gap**. One look. Keep 173.44 |
| 02 | Six trail chapters cited in order. Right/wrong card started. **Not** paid-grain `catalog_ask` |
| 03–04 | **Dark** if Gold missing. Remaining work on SWE vs DE vs tonight. Leaves with evals. Linear queue |
| 05–06 | **Type 01** leaf cranked. **Packet** on disk. Hash if Gold exists |
| 07–08 | `DF-SOURCE-005` = `CONFIRMED_SOURCE_DEFECT`. `HALF_UP`. Never rewrite `expected/` |
| 09 | Factory / flywheel. Type `06` not searched |

Host: pin Task-Spec 3.8.x, `cvg init`, project `ingest-landing` / `dlt-gold` / `orchestrate-serve`. Linear is the board, not the judge. Mesh is **not** inside Task-Spec.

## How to write a beat file

```text
# NN · name
- Slide:
- Who:
- Next: NN+1-….md

## Do / Prompt (verbatim)
## Proof
## If fail
```

Homework for the room is not a beat.

If `agenda/dN.md` and `run/dN/` disagree, **agenda wins on scope**.
Fix the run file. Do not invent a sixth type or a Pass the brief did
not authorize.
